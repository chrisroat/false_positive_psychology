# Understanding _False Postive Psychology_

The [table_1.ipynb](table_1.ipynb) Jupyter notebook attempts to reproduce __Table 1__ in [_False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant_ by Joseph P. Simmons, Leif D. Nelson, and Uri Simonsohn.](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797611417632). The paper shows that simple decisions made by an experimenter after looking at the data can lead to incorrect statistics and a high false positive rate. This is often called p-hacking, though is often not done with nefarious intentions.  The paper reinforces how important it is to determine your experiment and analysis design up front, before data taking commences.
